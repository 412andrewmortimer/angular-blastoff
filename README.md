## Setup

1. Star this repo so you get notifications of any future updates.
2. __(Windows Only)__ Install Git for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
3. Install node.js version 8 - 10: https://nodejs.org
4. `npm install -g @angular/cli`
5. `git clone https://github.com/aaronfrost/angular-blastoff`
6. `cd angular-blastoff`
7. `npm install`

#### Errors on step 4
On some new installations of Node, your system will give you permission errors when you try to install node packages globally. If this happens to you, come find the instructors to help you. If you are attempting this before the class and have errors, reach out to Brian and Aaron on twitter: @brian_love and @aaronfrost

#### Checking your version of Node.js
If you aren't sure what the version of node you are running is, run the following command from a terminal window and it will tell you:

```bash
node -v
```

If it returns value lower than 8.0 or higher than 10.x, you need to update your installation.
